This is a template project for building a Corona app that can update its assets from the Internet.

# Usage

To customize your app's starter content, modify starter_content/app.json and replace the images in starter_content/images.
app.json is the asset manifest file that contains the list and the URLs of your app assets.

To customize the URL from which the app downloads updates, modify the call to downloadUpdates() in the initializeGame function in loadmenu.lua.
